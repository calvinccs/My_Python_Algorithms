The three line types of interest are Attribute, Case and Vote. Each Attribute is a website, each Case is a user and each Vote is an Attribute that the user visited. For more details, please read the data description file for the structure of the data set.\n",

    "##Task:\n",
    "1. Assuming we are at a time such that we only have the training data, we want to recommend websites that the users should visit based on their user ID (case ID number). Please construct a recommender system, train it with the training data set and then conduct recommendation for the users given the user ID.\n",
    "2. Please also write the procedure to test your recommender with the test data set. Explain the metrics that you use for the testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Please also answer the following questions:\n",
    "1. What are the pros and cons of the recommendation algorithm you have used?\n",
    "2. How did you evaluate your recommender's performance? Why?\n",
    "3. Are you happy with you recommender's results? What could be a suitable baseline to compare your classifier's performance to?\n",
    "\n",
    "##Remarks:\n",
    "1. The challenge does not have 'the one' solution or answer. There are many ways to approach the task. Same holds true for the accompanying questions. Please motivate all the choices you have made.\n",
    "2. We have stated the task with many implicit and explicit requirements. If you cannot comply with any of these requirements, please state this and work around.\n",
    "3. We also value your input on how this challenge can be improved.\n",
    "4. Very important: we want to see how you think. Please write down all your thoughts, however preliminary. We much prefer that you discuss an issue without offering a solution, rather than not mentioning it.\n"

    "## What are the pros and cons of the recommendation algorithm you have used?\n",
    "\n",
    "In term of the database that form our recommendation statistics, it is based on the cases records, which consist of 32711 cases. The Pros would be that it is easy to update, e.g. when we have more data we can add them into the database so ideally we know which Vroot is most related to another Vroot. However, it is not tailor-made of each individual and the priority of our recommendation is only based on the public record. Furthermore, the relationship is based on one initial and one relation, but sometimes, a more powerful prediction would be two initials and one relation, this system has not been use in our database.\n",
    "\n",
    "In term of formulating the recommendation, our strategy is based on the rating of the relationship. For example, if 1001 has a strong relationship with 1002, i.e. 1002 will be recommended when everytimes the case visit 1001 as long as it is in the last 5 entry in the history. Surely a weighting system on the history will be useful, i.e. Vroot at the last visit should weight higher than Vroot visit a while ago. \n",
    "    \n",
    "## How did you evaluate your recommender's performance? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this algorithm, we will recommend 5 Vroots and we want to know if they will match the case's 'future' record. If our recommendation match the case's near future, that should score higher matching the far future. If our higher priority recommendation match the case's future, that should score higher than our lower priority cases. Based on this criteria, the score of each prediction will between 0 to 1, i.e. full point (1) will be given when the highest prority recommendation hit the next target. Or cases that we predict more than one future vote, normalise factors is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, based on 4000 cases, there are 2800 cases with more than one entry, and we based on these cases to evaluate the performance, i.e. based on the past 5 votes (or available votes) to predict the next 5 votes (or available votes). The overall score is the average of every single predictions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Are you happy with you recommender's results? What could be a suitable baseline to compare your classifier's performance to?\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall score is around 0.5, which is quite high considering other similar web prediction application such as Expedia (https://www.dataquest.io/blog/kaggle-tutorial/), however, the Expedia is a far more complicate exercise and the scoring system is much tougher, they need to predict the hotel booking but I only need to predict the next Vroot. Furthermore, the testing sample in this exercise is within the trainning set so it may overfit, too.\n"

    "### The challenge does not have 'the one' solution or answer. There are many ways to approach the task. Same holds true for the accompanying questions. Please motivate all the choices you have made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach I am considering is related to the way how Vroot are weighted. When more than one vote in the history, the current method just use a multiple criteria to filter out the highest hits Vroot. But when one of the vote is highly popular (i.e. there are many high hits Vroots), then recommendation based on other vote may undermine. So this maybe the next exercise.\n",

    "I think I did learn a lot by doing this exrcise, especially I never did any website recommendation data project works before. As a result, it is rather difficult to understand the problem at the start, such as what is Vroot, attribute etc. It could be better if there is a link to show how the website look like.\n",

    "### Very important: we want to see how you think. Please write down all your thoughts, however preliminary. We much prefer that you discuss an issue without offering a solution, rather than not mentioning it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think this exercise is more related developing algorithm and using functions in pandas, but not much in machine learning. I have been thinking of how to apply machine learning to solve this problem, such as group the Vroot into clusters and then the recommendation would be based on which cluster that the past vote belong to. Such as the hits number to other Vroot can formulate a series and plot them in a graph. \n"
